      <p>
         This site, by its nature will be inaccessible, as it requres vision.
      </p>
      <p>
         People who are colourblind see things differently to people who don't suffer colour vision deficiencies.
         While there are several sites that simulate colourblindness, none of them seem to represent what I see.
         This is an attempt to create a version that represents what I see.
      </p>
      <h2>Flatla & Gutwin technique</h2>
      <p>
         Flatla and Gutwin proposed a technique that requires a calibration to model the colourblindness, and
         then use that to process images to simulate the colourblindness (<a href="#Flatla_Gutwin_2012">2012</a>).
         The calibration technique displays a circle with 1/8 missing, and the user selects the section that is
         missing (<a href="#Flatla_Gutwin_2011">Flatla & Gutwin, 2011</a>). Their base patern is a grey, and the
         other colours are selected using binary search along the lines of confusion and then estimating an elipse,
         that contains the colours that a person who is colour vision deficient can't difrentiate.
      </p>
      <p>
         In this initial version, instead of testing along the lines of confusion, I will be using the appraoch of
         radiating out from the background colour in 12 directions, which was determiend by Birch, Barbur & Harlow to
         be adequate for most purposes(<a href="#Birch_Barbur_Harlow_2007">, 2007</a>). The rest of the calibration
         will follow Flatla & Gutwin's approach.
      </p>

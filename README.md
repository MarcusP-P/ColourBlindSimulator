# Colour Blind Simulator

The aim of this project is to simulate colour blindness. I know
there are many others, but none of them seen to simulate colour
blindness in the same way as I see it. Initially, I wanted to modify 
the [jsColorblindSimulator project][jsColorblindSimulator] to add
additional modes. I may still port them later.
